The dataset contains images of MRI segmentation and was uploaded to Kaggle by data engineer Sarvesh Dubey. The 6400 image files are divided into two sets â€” training and testing. Within each set, there are four categories based on the severity of disease in the MRI scans: MildDemented, VeryMildDemented, NonDemented, and ModerateDemented. More information about the dataset can be found on the Kaggle page from where it was retrieved.
